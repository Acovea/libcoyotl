The libcoyotl class collection defies clear categorization; in essence,
these are tool that I've found useful in a variety of applications.
Rather than have several "little" libraries lying about, I decided to
create a single "catch all" library.

Among the algorithms included:

    - A polymorphic collections of the best psuedorandom number
      generators, including the Mersenne Twister and Marsaglia's
      favorites.
      
    - Utilities for working with real numbers, including additional
      functions for trigonometry, least common multiple, greatest
      common denominator, rounding, and other purposes.
      
    - A simple cross-platform command-line parser.
    
    - A framework for generating random rectangular mazes.
    
    - A template for fixed-point math based on different integer sizes
      and decimal point locations.
      
    - Templatized sorting utilities (designed before Std. C++'s
      <algorithms>, but still useful)
    
    - Validation tools for "Design by Contract" programming.
    
Complete API documentation can be generated with a simple "make docs"
command. The test subdirectory contains a basic validation and test
suite; you can review this code to see how things work.
